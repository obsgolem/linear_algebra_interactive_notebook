- What is linear algebra?
  - A bad definition then a good one
- Linear algebra is the study of vectors
  - What is a vector?
    - A vector is not a list of numbers (though a list of numbers can be a vector)
    - Children know what vectors are intuitively
      - Direction and distance
      - No coordinate grid
      - Coordinate grids are extra structure and are not mandatory
  - Operations on vectors
    - Addition
    - Scaling
  - There are other operations, but they are not fundemental like these.
  - Furthermore, anything with an adding and scaling operation, subject to certain properties, can be thought of as a vector
  - Examples: Arrows, R^n, polynomials
  - We call these vector spaces
  - Another bad definition of linear algebra: the study of vector spaces
- What is a basis?
  - Linear combinations
    - A linear combination of a set of vectors is a sum of the vectors, each with a scale factor applied.
    - Example
  - Linear independence
    - A linearly independent set of vectors is one that has no redundant vectors
    - In other words, no vector in the set can be written as a sum of the others
    - Examples:
  - Generating set
    - Every vector in the plane can be written as a linear combination of these two vectors:
    - Thus these vectors are called a generating (or spanning) set for the plane.
    - In general, given a set of vectors you can form the _span_ of them by taking all possible linear combinations of the vectors.
    - In this case, the original set is called the generating set of the _span_
  - Basis
    - A basis for a vector space is a linearly independent generating set for that space
    - In other words, every vector in the space can be written uniquely as a linear combination of the vectors in the basis
  - Dimension
    - Every basis has the same number of vectors
    - This number is called the dimension
  - Examples of bases:
  - Note that a choice of basis gives a choice of coordinate grid
  - Note that choice of basis is entirely arbitrary. Vectors exist independently of bases
  - R^3 is a special vector space with a distinguished choice of basis: [1, 0, 0], [0, 1, 0], [0, 0, 1].
- What is a linear transform?
  - Recall the definition of a function in math:
    - a function f takes a vector v and produces an output vector f(v). The vector it produces is always the same given the same input vector
    - Functions have a domain and a codomain, representing the vector spaces that the input and output are in.
    - If the input space is V and the output space is W we write this as f: V -> W. We read this as "f is a function from V to W".
  - A linear transform is a function satisfying an additional property: linearity
    - Preservation of addition: f(u+v)=f(u)+f(v)
    - Preservation of scaling: f(cv)=cf(v)
  - Linearity is sort of like the distributive law and commutative law combined.
  - Examples:
  - Freshman's dream
    - A common error by young or inexperience mathematical discipuli is to assume a nonlinear operation is linear. As an example:
    - assuming (x+y)^n=x^n+y^n
  - Why is linearity important?
    - Lots of reasons: first of all a lot of important functions are linear
    - Second of all, they are simpler to deal with, as we shall soon see
    - Third, many functions can be approximated by linear functions. Ask if you want further details on this
  - Composition of linear functions
    - Given any two functions, f and g, you can form the composition of them: f(g(v)).
    - This means, first apply the transform g, then apply the transform f to the output of it
    - Examples:
    - Note that in order for functions to be composable their domains and codomains must match up like f: V -> W and g: U -> V
  - Isomorphism
    - If every vector in the codomain comes from a unique vector in the domain, we call this an isomorphism
    - Examples:
  - A choice of a basis for a vector space is the same as choosing an isomorphism to R^n (where n is the dimension).
    - We can think of this function as assigning coordinates to every vector in our domain
  * A better definition of linear algebra: The study of vector spaces and linear transforms between them
- What is a matrix?
  - Matrices are to basis as coordinates are to vector spaces
  - We note that if the domain of a linear transform is given a choice of basis, then the output of the linear transform is entirely determined by the value of the function on the basis
  - Examples:
  - From this we can see that in order to represent a basis we can just list out the output vectors of our basis [v_1 v_2 v_3 ... v_n]
    - This means that the first vector in our basis goes to v_1, the second vector goes to v_2, etc
  - If we give the codomain a basis, then we can write the output vectors in coordinates, and the result of this is the matrix of the transform
    - The matrix depends on the choice of basis of both the domain and codomain
  - If the domain and codomain are the same vector space, then we can choose a single common basis for both
    - Then for each linear transform there is a unique matrix with respect to that basis
  - Examples:
  - Composition of linear transforms corresponds to matrix multiplication
    - I won't go through all the details, but
    - If you have two linear transforms, both of which have the same domain and codomain, you may choose a basis and get a matrix for each of them
    - You may compose them, getting another linear transform. Hence, the composition has a matrix too
    - If you work through the details of this, it turns out that the matrix of the composition corresponds to the matrix multiplication of the matrices of the two transforms
